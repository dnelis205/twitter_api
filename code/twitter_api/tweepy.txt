Cursor object is used for "pagintation", for scrolling between pages. Effectively iterates through pages rather than looping.
Makes it quicker to do the below:
page = 1
while True:
    statuses = api.user_timeline(page=page)
    if statuses:
        for status in statuses:
            # process status here
            process_status(status)
    else:
        # All done
        break
    page += 1  # next page

vs.

for status in tweepy.Cursor(api.user_timeline).items(): #items says how many actual objects (soo 200 is a list of 200 tweets or something else)
    # process status here
    process_status(status)
